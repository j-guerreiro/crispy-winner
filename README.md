### Overview
The name of this API is Sand Spice, because the samples we provied are special spices for cooks.
This is fictional and it is for studying purposes.

But let's say that our client has products on a warehouse and it wants their website or APP
to display they warehouse products information on the front-end of their site.

### Overview of the Problem
Our client operates a warehouse and wishes to display information about their products on their website or app. The client's goal is to provide customers with easy access to detailed information about the products available in their warehouse. This information may include product names, descriptions, quantities available, prices, and any other relevant details.

### Proposed Solution
To address the client's needs, we propose developing an API that allows the client to retrieve product information from their warehouse database and display it on their website or app. The API will follow RESTful principles, providing endpoints for clients to interact with resources such as products.

### Key Features:
Product Information Retrieval: The API will allow clients to retrieve information about products stored in the warehouse. Clients can query the API to obtain details such as product names, descriptions, quantities available, prices, and other relevant attributes.

* Flexible Querying: Clients can query the API using various parameters such as product name, category, price range, availability, etc., to narrow down their search and find the products they're interested in.

* Authentication and Authorization: To ensure data security and privacy, the API will implement authentication and authorization mechanisms. Clients will need to authenticate themselves before accessing certain endpoints, and authorization rules will determine which resources they can access.

* Scalability and Performance: The API will be designed to handle a large volume of requests efficiently, ensuring fast response times and minimal downtime. Scalability will be achieved through proper design considerations such as caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling.

* Documentation and Support: Comprehensive documentation will be provided to guide clients on how to use the API effectively. This documentation will include details about endpoint URLs, request/response formats, authentication methods, error handling, and usage examples.

By implementing this solution, our client will be able to seamlessly integrate their warehouse product information into their website or app, providing customers with a rich and informative shopping experience. The API will serve as a reliable and efficient bridge between the warehouse database and the client's frontend platform.

### What is this API intended to do?

This API should allow retrieving data from endpoints with:

Samples:
* Name
* Quantity
* Availability
* Description
* Specialty (ex: for cooks specialized in japanese food/sea food)
* Price

### Architecture

RESTful architecture, resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and the client interacts with those resources with standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Examples of GET method:

Get all samples:
Request: GET :/api/v1/samples

Get all samples by name:
Request: GET :/api/v1/samples/name

Other ideas for get requests:

* Get by availability
* Get by specialty
* Get by quantity

### Example of POST method:

* Create sample

### Example of PUT method:

* Update sample

### Example of DELETE method

* Remove sample

This would be an initial idea of this project.
